# Crop-yield-prediction-using-machine-learning
This project focuses on utilizing the power of machine learning to forecast crop yields in India, aiming to empower farmers with the tools to optimize their harvests and income. By analyzing critical factors such as temperature, rainfall, soil pH, and nutrient levels, machine learning algorithms can deliver precise predictions and actionable insights, guiding farmers on the best crops to cultivate. Advanced techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and feedforward networks are employed to process data, enabling the creation of an accurate and reliable model for crop yield prediction. This innovative approach fosters smarter, data-driven decision-making, revolutionizing farming practices and supporting sustainable agricultural growth.
